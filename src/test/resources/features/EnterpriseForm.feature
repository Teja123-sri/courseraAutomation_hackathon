# Feature: Enterprise / Business Form Validation
# Flow 3 - Go to Coursera For Business
#           Fill "Ready to learn more?" contact form
#           Enter an INVALID email (missing @)
#           Capture and assert the error message
#
# NOTE: Coursera's form shows different error messages:
# - "This field is required." for empty fields
# - "Must be valid email. example@yourdomain.com" for invalid email
# - "Please enter a valid email address" (HTML5 validation)
# The assertion checks for "valid email" which covers the
# invalid-email case, OR we also accept "required" if the form
# validation triggers a required-field error.
